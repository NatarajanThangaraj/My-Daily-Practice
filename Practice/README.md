# My-Daily-Practice Repository

This repository serves as a collection of daily practice exercises and solutions for various programming concepts and problems. It is organized into the following packages:

## 1. LeetCode

The `LeetCode` package contains solutions and implementations for problems sourced from LeetCode, a platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges.

## 2. AlgorithmicProblems

The `AlgorithmicProblems` package includes implementations and solutions for algorithmic problems, providing a practical approach to algorithm design and optimization.

## 3. Matrix

The `Matrix` package focuses on problems and solutions related to matrix manipulation, traversal, and algorithms involving two-dimensional arrays.

## 4. Pattern

The `Pattern` package explores different programming patterns, including but not limited to, design patterns, algorithmic patterns, and coding patterns.

## 5. DynamicProgramming

The `DynamicProgramming` package is dedicated to dynamic programming problems and solutions, emphasizing optimization techniques for solving complex problems.

## 6. Recursion

In the `Recursion` package, you will find implementations and exercises related to recursive algorithms, exploring the concept of functions calling themselves.

## 7. Inheritance

The `Inheritance` package delves into object-oriented programming concepts, specifically focusing on inheritance and its applications in designing class hierarchies.

Feel free to explore and contribute to each package. Happy coding!
