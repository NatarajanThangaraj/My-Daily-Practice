## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find solutions to a variety of problems that I've encountered and worked on. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and share knowledge with the community.

## Solving Approach

My approach to problem-solving includes:
- Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Using pseudocode to plan the solution before coding.
- Experimenting with different approaches and optimizing for efficiency.
- Documenting the thought process and rationale behind each solution.

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback or suggest alternative approaches.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/coding-challenges**: Contains solutions to coding challenges from various online platforms.
- **/algorithmic-puzzles**: Includes solutions to algorithmic puzzles and problems.
- **/data-structures**: Implements and demonstrates various data structures.
- **/miscellaneous**: Houses solutions to other types of problems or challenges.

Feel free to navigate through the folders based on the type of problems you're interested in.

## Programming Languages
- Java


Each problem solution includes information about the programming language used.
